## About
CuChemTools is a free, and open-source C++/CUDA and Python library for computing various quantities efficiently 
using NVIDIA GPU's in quantum chemistry. It is highly-optimized and vectorized, making it useful for cases
where efficiency matters.

CuChemTools can read various wave-function formats (wfn, wfx, molden and fchk) using IOData and supports up-to g-type orbitals. 
Please see the website for more information.

To report any issues or ask questions, either [open an issue](
https://github.com/qtchem/cuchemtools/issues/new) or email [qcdevs@gmail.com]().
